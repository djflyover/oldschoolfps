        <div id="content">
            <p><strong>Quake</strong> is a <a href="../games/fps.html" class="link">first-person shooter</a> video game, developed by id Software and published by GT Interactive in 1996. It is the first game in the Quake series. In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using a wide array of weapons.</p>
            <p>Unlike the Doom engine before it, the Quake engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and had early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After Doom helped popularize multiplayer deathmatches, Quake added various multiplayer options. Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the QuakeWorld update and software such as QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable. It features music composed by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.</p> <br/>
            

            <h3>Plot</h3>
            
            <p>In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the protagonist known as Ranger (voiced by Trent Reznor) who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy code-named "Quake". The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a "Slipgate"; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the "Human" dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.</p>
            
            <figure class="figure-left">
                    <div><a href="../images/quake1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/quake1.jpg" width="300" height="170" alt="Quake"></a></div>
                    <figcaption>Ranger</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The sole surviving protagonist in "Operation Counterstrike" is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger's main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy later discovered as Shub-Niggurath and ending the invasion of Earth.</p> 
            <p>The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or "maps", divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game's final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of gothic, medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of Doom (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The latter is inspired by several dark fantasy influences, most notably that of H. P. Lovecraft. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the "Spawn" enemies are called "Formless Spawn of Tsathoggua" in the manual, the boss of the first episode is named Chthon, and the final boss is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a Dark Young). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and The Nameless City. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.</p><br/>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>

            <p>Quake has six sequels: Quake II, Quake III Arena, Quake 4, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Quake Live and Quake Champions. The Quake series changes its focus frequently; the story of Quake II is not connected to the original Quake. This is mostly because Quake II was originally intended to be a separate franchise (Quake II was initially only a tentative title), a plan that was thwarted when most of the other names id Software had tried to use were already taken. Quake III Arena has little to do with either of its predecessors but set in the same universe as Quake II and Quake 4, shedding the single-player missions in favor of deathmatch against the A.I. or online. One of the few unifying elements for the first three titles was the Quake logo-shaped rune for "quad damage" that made the player's weapons and attacks several times as powerful for a short duration. The first three titles pioneered id Software's next-generation graphics engine before it was licensed out.</p>
            <p>In 2002, a version of Quake was produced for mobile phones. A copy of Quake was also released as a compilation in 2001, labeled Ultimate Quake, which included the original Quake, Quake II, and Quake III Arena which was published by Activision. In 2008, Quake was honored at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the art form of user modifiable games. John Carmack accepted the award. Years after its original release, Quake is still regarded by many critics as one of the greatest and most influential games ever made.</p><br/>
            
            <h3>Strogg</h3>

                <figcaption>Visor. Typical Strogg</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The Strogg are an alien race who serve as the primary antagonists in Quake II and Quake 4, with the Makron being their leader. In Quake II, Makron uses the battle-mech style vessel Jorg. They are a playable faction in Quake III: Team Arena and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. The Strogg are a warlike cybernetic race, infamous for the systematic replacement of their ranks with prisoners of war, "stroggified" and assimilated through the modification of their bodies with mechanical weaponry and prosthetics. They maintain a massive global military-industrial complex with mines, ore refineries, light production plants, and heavy industrial manufacturing facilities throughout Stroggos. Their heavy reliance on industry has created a toxic environment that has killed much of the native plant and animal life on Stroggos, and the remaining animals are subject to horrible mutation.</p><br/>

            <h3>Reception</h3>

            <p>Quake was critically acclaimed on the PC. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the original PC version 93.22% and 94/100, the Nintendo 64 port 76.14% and 74/100, and the Sega Saturn version 64.50%. A Next Generation critic lauded the game's realistic 3D physics and genuinely unnerving sound effects. Major Mike of GamePro said Quake had been over-hyped but is excellent nonetheless, particularly its usage of its advanced 3D engine. He also praised the sound effects, atmospheric music, and graphics, though he criticized that the polygons used to construct the enemies are too obvious at close range. Less than a month after Quake was released (and a month before they actually reviewed the game), Next Generation listed it as number 9 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", saying that it is similar to Doom but supports a maximum of eight players instead of four. In 1996, Computer Gaming World listed "telefragged" as #1 on its list of "the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming". In 1997, the Game Developers Choice Awards gave Quake three spotlight awards for Best Sound Effects, Best Music or Soundtrack and Best On-Line/Internet Game.</p> <br/>
