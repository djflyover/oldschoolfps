            <p><strong>Half-Life</strong> (stylized HλLF-LIFE) is a series of <a href="../games/fps.html" class="link">first-person shooter</a> games developed and published by Valve. The major installments feature protagonist Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who battles an alien invasion. Two of these games, Half-Life and Half-Life 2, are full-length titles, while two more, Half-Life 2: Episode One and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, are shorter, episodic titles. A third episode, Half-Life 2: Episode Three, was scheduled for release by Christmas 2007, but is now described as vaporware.</p>
            <p>The first game in the Portal series, set in the same universe as Half-Life, was released in 2007.</p> <br/>

            <h3>Series overview</h3>

            <p>Half-Life, the first game in the series, takes place at the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico circa the turn of the 21st century. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist, is involved in an experiment that accidentally creates a dimensional rift to a trans-dimensional world called Xen, causing extraterrestrial life to swarm the facility and kill the staff. As Freeman and the survivors try to flee, a military unit is brought in to contain the situation, including killing those that try to escape. Freeman ultimately makes his way to Xen and eliminates the alien "leader", the Nihilanth, but is confronted by the G-Man, who places Freeman into stasis. Half-Life: Opposing Force follows military soldier Adrian Shephard as he helps to quell another alien invasion within the Black Mesa facility. Within Half-Life: Blue Shift, Black Mesa security worker Barney Calhoun works to escape from the facility with Dr. Rosenberg and two other scientists.</p>

            <p>Half-Life 2 starts about twenty years following the first game. With the death of the Nihilanth, the Black Mesa dimensional rift grew out of control, creating portal storms across Earth and further spread of alien creatures. These drew the attention of the technically-advanced alien force called the Combine that conquered Earth within seven hours, subjugating humanity to its control through mind-controlling transmissions that suppress their urge to fight back. Surviving humans are forced to live in former cities converted to internment camps and patrolled by the Combine and humans that have allied with them. G-Man wakes Freeman up to this world, sending him to City 17. Freeman regroups with members of the human resistance including former Black Mesa workers Barney Calhoun, Isaac Kleiner, and Eli Vance along with Eli's daughter Alyx Vance and her robotic pet D0g. Freeman is targeted as a threat by the Combine, but with his allies' help along with that of the alien Vortigaunt species, Freeman and Alyx are able to make their way into the Citadel, a gigantic tower in City 17 from which the Combine operate and send out their mind-controlling transmissions. They confront Wallace Breen, the human spokesman for the Combine, and attempt to destroy the Citadel by initiating the destruction of its dark energy reactor.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Within Half-Life 2: Episode One, the destruction of the Citadel's reactor has started a chain reaction that will take all of City 17 with it. Aided in part by the G-Man and the Vortigaunt, Freeman and Alyx escape the primary explosions and work to try to slow the reaction, giving the surviving humans the time needed to escape the city. However, they find that the Combine are attempting to accelerate the process, in part to alert the off-world Combine forces to their plight. Freeman and his allies safely make their way out of City 17 in time. In Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the massive explosion has created a superportal which could allow the full Combine force onto Earth. G-Man provides Freeman with the appropriate information on how to close the portal, as well as the location of the Borealis, a ship used by Aperture Science to test humanity's own version of portal technology. Freeman and his allies help to secure safety for the human survivors from City 17, and launch a satellite to shut down the superportal in time. Just as they are about to set off to locate the Borealis, a Combine Advisor appears and kills Eli, leaving Alyx in tears.</p><br/>

            <h3>Games</h3>
            
            <p>The Half-Life series includes a core set of titles which carry the main storyline. These games were released in chronological order, either portraying the events of one game from the perspective of a different character, or following on from the events that are depicted in the previous title. As of May 2010, the main series consists of the original video game and its sequel, as well as three expansion packs and two episodic games. A third episodic game remains in development. In addition, several spin-off titles have been released. These vary in nature, consisting of an arcade game, technology demonstration, and a series of puzzle games. The original game and its expansions all use Valve's GoldSrc game engine, a heavily modified Quake engine. The later games accompanying the sequel all use Valve's proprietary Source engine.</p><br/>

            <h3>Future and cancelled games</h3>

            <p>Half-Life 2: Episode Three concept art surfaced in 2008. Valve reportedly worked with sign language and was working on a deaf character. Valve released very little information about Episode Three in the following years; though Valve still discussed Half-Life, there was no clarity on whether Episode Three would be coming, whether Valve was instead planning Half-Life 3, or if Valve had forgone the property to better support the popular Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. In a March 2010 interview, Newell spoke of "broadening the emotional palette" of the series, and how the next Half-Life game may return to "genuinely scaring the player". In a 2011 interview with Develop magazine, Newell said: "We went through the episodes phase, and now we’re going towards shorter and even shorter cycles ... For me, ‘entertainment as a service’ is a clear distillation of the episodic content model." By 2011, Episode Three had still not emerged and was being described as vaporware.</p>
            <p>Return to Ravenholm, sometimes referred to as Half-Life 2: Episode Four, was under development by Arkane Studios before its cancellation. The episode would have featured the Half-Life location Ravenholm, a town infested with headcrabs and headcrab zombies. As it was set before the end of Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Valve felt it was constrained creatively. Another abandoned episode was under development by Junction Point Studios, a studio led by Warren Spector. Spector said that the episode would have shown how Ravenholm became the town seen in Half-Life 2, allowing them to feature more of the character of Father Grigori; images of this setting in their game appeared in early 2017. The game included a "magnet gun", which fired projectiles that would magnetize the metal surface they contract, drawing objects and enemies towards it, and would have been used both for combat and puzzles. Junction Point worked on it for a year, producing enough content to demonstrate one section of the game, and a vertical slice that demonstrated the mechanics of the magnet gun. Valve became uninterested in the project, and Spector dropped it in favour of Disney's Epic Mickey.</p>
            <p>In a 2015 interview with Geoff Keighley, Newell said that due to Valve's management-free structure, the company would only develop "a super classic kind of product" if a large number of employees began working on it together. He said this was unlikely as they would need to heed the lessons learned in supporting Portal 2. In 2016 and 2017, three key writers for the Half-Life and Portal series, Marc Laidlaw, Erik Wolpaw, and Chet Faliszek, left Valve. Journalists took this, coupled with the commitment Valve was making to supporting Dota 2, Counter-Strike and Steam, as an indicator that the Half-Life series was no longer in development.</p>
            <p>On August 24, 2017, Laidlaw posted a short story, "Epistle 3", on his website. Laidlaw described the story as a "fanfic ... [a] snapshot of a dream I had many years ago", and many journalists interpreted it as a summary of what could have been the plot for Half-Life 2: Episode Three. The story features characters with names similar to Half-Life characters, such as "Gertie Fremont" in place of Gordon Freeman. Substituting the characters with their Half-Life counterparts, the story sees Freeman and his allies travel to the Arctic to board the Borealis, a ship that travels erratically through time and space, where they "confront myriad versions" of themselves. They rig the ship to travel to the heart of the Combine empire and self-destruct, but Gordon realizes the explosion is not sufficient to destroy the Combine's Dyson Sphere. Alyx is taken by the G-Man and Gordon is rescued by the Vortigaunts before he is sent to a beach. After Laidlaw published the story, some players left negative reviews for Dota 2 on Steam, believing that Valve had forgone the Half-Life series in favor of Dota 2. Laidlaw's posting led to a number of fan-driven efforts to recreate Episode Three on their own, with "Project Borealis" being the largest group effort towards this.</p><br/>

            <h3>Cultural influence and reception</h3>

            <p>A short film based upon Half-Life, titled Half-Life: Uplink, was developed by Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and released on March 15, 1999. However, Sierra withdrew it from circulation after Sierra and Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film. The critical reception of the film was very poor. The film's plot was that of a journalist attempting to infiltrate the Black Mesa Research Facility and discover what was happening there.</p>
            <p>In early 2009, the Purchase Brothers, a Toronto-based film company, released a five-minute film based on Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life: Escape from City-17. The film combines live-action footage with 3D animation created using the Source SDK. It was well received by Valve. On August 25, 2010 they released a nearly 15-minute long sequel. In late 2010 a trailer for a Half-Life inspired independent short film entitled Beyond Black Mesa was released. Directed by Brian Curtin, it follows the character Adrian Shephard. The full short film was released online on January 21, 2011.</p><br/>
